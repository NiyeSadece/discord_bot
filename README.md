# discord_bot
 
Just some community bot for an RP discord server.

It counts characters in a message and automatically adds creativity exp. There is simple leveling up system, option to show the ranking (as of now up to 25 people), manually add and subtract exp as well as set user active or inactive, so they show/don't show in the ranking.

Build with discord.py and Django REST Framework.

Todo: build an actual website I guess.
